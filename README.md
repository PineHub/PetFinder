# CS361-PetFinder
Software Engineering Project B Code

This is a simple web-based pet database that allows a user to add, remove, and view a database of lost and found pets.
It is powered by Node.js and a mySQL database.

How to run PetFinder via the Cloud9 share:
1.  Editor link is https://ide.c9.io/summonkraken/cs361_projectb_group6_petfinder.
2.  in BASH: phpmyadmin-ctl install
3.  in BASH: mysql-ctl start
4.  The command to start the web server should already have a tab for Run but if not, the command is node bin/www
5.  Go to the tab for web preview then "Pop out into New Window." 

Click on 'Lost a Pet' to add a pet to the database.  Click it again to remove the entry forms.
Do the same for 'Found a Pet' as well as 'Search for a Pet'.
